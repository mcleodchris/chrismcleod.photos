alt: A vibrant display of colorful umbrellas hangs above a narrow street,
  creating a lively atmosphere. People walk beneath the umbrellas, which are
  suspended by wires. Stone buildings line the street, with one featuring a sign
  that reads, "THE UMBRELLA PROJECT RETURNS TO ABERDEEN!" The sky is partly
  cloudy, adding to the cheerful ambiance.
