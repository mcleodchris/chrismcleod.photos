alt: Skeletal figures are arranged on a cutting mat, showcasing various
  miniature models, predominantly in dark tone. A central figure stands larger,
  atop a broken tomb, indicating a commanding position, surrounded by smaller
  figures, some holding banners, and flanked by deathly knights on skeletal
  steeds. These miniatures are assembled, but unpainted, “Deathrattle”
  miniatures by Games Workshop, for their fantasy game Age of Sigmar. The
  backdrop includes various painting materials and tools, suggesting an active
  workspace for model painting or assembly.

The new Deathrattle miniatures are really, really, nice to put together. I assembled everything in the box much quicker than I expected. Onwards to paint!
