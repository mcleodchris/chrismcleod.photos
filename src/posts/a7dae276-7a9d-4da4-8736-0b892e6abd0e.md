alt: A collection of unpainted miniature figures, depicting warriors with
  various weapons and shields, is arranged in a cluster on a cutting mat.
  Surrounding them are tools and materials used for modelling, including a black
  drawstring bag, a wooden box, and bottles of paint. The setting suggests an
  area for hobby crafting.
