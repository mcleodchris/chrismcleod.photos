alt: A group of space marine miniatures arranged around a central figure, which
  is viewed from the back, to show off a flowing robe painted a deep magenta
  colour. The figures are all wearing heavy silver armour with gold accents, and
  holding various weapons. The workspace is cluttered with paints and tools,
  suggesting an active model creation or painting process.

Iâ€™m quite happy with how this cape I painted the other day turned out. Especially for the relatively short amount of time spent on it.
