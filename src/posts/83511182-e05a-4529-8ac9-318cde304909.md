alt: 2 rows of 5 Space Marine Intercessors, on a grey cutting mat. They are
  painted in a black armoured colour scheme, with a tarnished gold Imperialis on
  their chests. One has a single silver arm and shoulder pad, and is carrying a
  large banner pole. Some chains have been picked out which are wrapped around
  their weapons. Many details are unpainted, and they are missing heads and
  shoulder pads, indicating they are a work in progress.

Finally dipping back into a project I first started in 2021(!) - a small 40K Crusade project. Many more steps to go, but drybrushing and Xpress Color is carrying the day. All the black armour was painted in about an hour.
