alt: A greetings card featuring a cartoonish frog presented in a playful,
  Dracula-like outfit, adorned with a bow tie and cape. The frog has a wide
  mouth and large eyes, with blood-stained fangs poking from the corners of its
  mouth. In the background, various colourful books are neatly arranged on a
  shelf. A small bat silhouette is featured above the frog, adding a whimsical
  element.
