alt: A detailed grey model of a bipedal robot stands on a circular black base.
  It is positioned centrally on a wooden surface, with its two gun arms raised,
  as if ready for action. It has a hunched over look due to the curving armoured
  carapace that rises over its head. The background features cluttered work
  surfaces with various tools and bottles, indicating a creative workspace.

Another wee dude ready for priming tomorrow. The Combat Patrol rules in White Dwarf have me a blast of inspiration, so I’m building a bunch of these Armigers. I’m going to have at least 3 different pairings by the end of it! ⚔️
