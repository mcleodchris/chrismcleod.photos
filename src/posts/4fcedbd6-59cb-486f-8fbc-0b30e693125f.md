alt: "A framed poster displays a playful cartoon-style image featuring two
  characters: a round, white cinnamon roll and a black cup. They stand together,
  smiling, with pastry boxes on either side. Bold text above them reads,
  'SECURED THE GOODS,' against a vibrant pink background, creating a cheerful
  dining atmosphere."
