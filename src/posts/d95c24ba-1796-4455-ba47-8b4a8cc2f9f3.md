alt: "A street sign displays two directions with humorous phrases: 'The right to
  be lazy' pointing in to the right of the photo, and 'Capitalist guilt'
  pointing in the same direction. The sign is mounted on a pole near a
  multi-story building with a mix of textured walls and windows, reflecting an
  urban context."
