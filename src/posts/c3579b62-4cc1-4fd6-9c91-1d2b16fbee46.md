alt: "Two raspberry pi single-board computers, in small, black, metal chassis. One is labelled 'Dev Box', the other is labelled 'Docker'. There is a power cable connected to each, and green status lights indicate they are powered on. They sit on a wooden surface. There is a table lamp next to them, and an Apple Homepod speaker behind them."
