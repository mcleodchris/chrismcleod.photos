alt: A collection of Adeptus Custodes miniature figures, by Games Workshop, is
  arranged on simulated rocky terrain. The figures, resembling heavily armoured
  warriors, display gold and red colour schemes, adorned with ornate designs and
  blue gemstones. Some wield weapons like swords and spears, while others hold
  banners. The background features a painted desert landscape in warm tones.
